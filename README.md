# Welcome!
This repo will server as a guide to my notes as to not forget basic things about data analysis.
## This is just a guide for myself and other are welcome to use it
These files will help me remember core concepts when it comes to analysing data. Every day routine that cannot be forgotten easily.
# How to use it
So there are going to be a couple of .ipynb files that are ordered by names such as "basics", "basics 2", "intermediate", "advanced" and so on.

Each one of them will cover the fundamental and important methods and workflow to specific datasets.

There is not a single way to use it. You can analyse whatever file you'd like to get more details of some codes and it'll guide you through it
